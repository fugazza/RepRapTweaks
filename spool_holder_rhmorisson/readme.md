RHMorisson's Mendel Snap-in Filament Spool Holder
=================================================

Spool holder is something you must have. I am fully satisfied with this one originally taken from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:22292 and I include it with pleasure into my collection of RepRap Tweaks.

The only thing that needs improvement is the wheel for supporting the spool, which does not fit all spools -> needs improvement, ideally to make it parametric.
